 UHD Weighted Graphs

### What is Weighted Graph?
* A Weighted Graph is a graph with a numerical weight for every section. Therefore, a weighted graph is a special category of graphs in which the mark numbers (usually called positive) are displayed.

### Weighted Graph Algorithms with Python
* Graph algorithms are provided with Python implementation. The minimum graphical interface and many groups that enforce this interface are specified. Any unsused python artifacts may be graph nodes. The leading edges is an example of a type of edge within a graph. Graphs are graph level examples. It is based on the lists of neighboring images, but with a simple look-up of nodes and neighbors. It is also important for other implementations of this type.
* In this project, many algorithms are implemented using a unified approach. There are separate classes and modules devoted to the three different algorithms. The three algorithms for finding a minimum spanning tree are implemented: the Boruvka's Algorithm, Prim's Algorithm (three implementations), and the Kruskal's Algorithm. 
* In this Particular Project, We used Prim's algorithms. *

### What does this Project do?
* This project is specifically designed to use Prim's Algorithm to create graphs and label them in a random order. This order is designed based on the weight of the edges and the status of the nodes. The status of a node is when the node is used or unused. After creating a graph, every node will be labeled in a random order, and starts at 0. When starting, the program will then begin to choose the edge with the least amount of weight, and then use the node connected to that weight. If the node is already used, the path will be blocked and cannot be used again.
